//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: No, because the values passed in to the **init** function have an optional string type meaning that the value could be either a String or nill type whereas the instant variables are of String type.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reversed())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ..< numElements {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }

//: There is nothing wrong with the **for loop**. The function must return a boolean value, so if it does not find a differing element in a word for elements in all indices, it should return true after the for loop. We are also calling arePalindroms with a class not an instance so we have to change the arePalindroms to a class function.

    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [Character : Int]() //Line X
        var lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }

            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }

        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true //nil
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.

    
//: Need to initialize the **countLetters** dictionary. This function is called by an instance of a class when it is a class function. We have to fix this by changing it to a instance function by deleting "class". Also this function returns a boolean value so we must return true instead of nil.
